# Install UX — one-line install path and getting-started tutorial

## Description

Public-launch prerequisite: establish a one-line install path, populate README.md install section, and write the getting-started tutorial. This is the final M3 item because the API must be stable (post-rename, post-adapter-framework) before documenting it. Per retrospective §13.11 and §6.

### Deliverables

1. **One-line install** — `uv tool install specflow` or equivalent `uvx` path works end-to-end. Verify package metadata in `pyproject.toml` is complete (description, classifiers, URLs, entry points).

2. **README.md install section** — Install command, quick-verify (`specflow --help`), link to `docs/getting-started.md`.

3. **`docs/getting-started.md`** — Tutorial-shaped, transcript-style walkthrough. Covers: install → `specflow init` → `/specflow-discover` a simple REQ → `/specflow-plan` → `/specflow-execute` → verify results. Written against the stable post-rename API.

4. **Package metadata** — `pyproject.toml` has correct `description`, `classifiers` (Development Status, Topic, etc.), `project.urls` (Homepage, Documentation, Repository), and `[project.scripts]` entry point.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `uv tool install specflow` (or the documented equivalent) installs the CLI and `specflow --help` works with no additional setup

2. `pyproject.toml` contains complete package metadata: description, version, classifiers, project URLs, and entry point

3. `README.md` has an install section with the one-liner, a quick-verify command, and links to docs

4. `docs/getting-started.md` exists as a transcript-style tutorial that walks a new user from cold install through a complete discover→plan→execute cycle

5. All command names in docs/getting-started.md use post-rename names (artifact-lint, artifact-review, change-impact, etc.)

## Out of Scope

- Publishing to PyPI (separate release step)
- GitHub Actions release workflow
- Logo, branding, landing page

## Dependencies

- STORY-022 (command rename — docs must reference final command names)
- STORY-023 (docs restructure — getting-started.md goes in the restructured docs/)
- STORY-026 (adapter framework — API surface must be stable)
